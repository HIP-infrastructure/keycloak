### Overview

This Flask application serves as a backend service for managing user accounts, groups, and group memberships in a Keycloak identity and access management system. It provides a RESTful API for creating, deleting, and retrieving user and group information within specified Keycloak realms.

### Features

- **User Management**: Create and delete user accounts in Keycloak.
- **Group Management**: Create and delete groups, including 'administrators' sub-groups.
- **Group Membership Retrieval**: Retrieve detailed information about user group memberships.
- **User Information Retrieval**: Get detailed information about user accounts, including group memberships and administrator status.
- **Health Check**: Endpoint to check the health of the backend service.

### Endpoints

1. **User Creation**: `POST /identity/users` - Create a new user account in Keycloak.
2. **User Deletion**: `DELETE /identity/users/<user_name>` - Delete a user account from Keycloak.
3. **User Group Membership Retrieval**: `GET /projects/users/<user_name>` - Retrieve a user's group membership information.
4. **User Information Retrieval**: `GET /identity/users/<user_name>` - Get detailed information about a user account.
5. **Group Creation**: `POST /identity/groups` - Create a new group in Keycloak.
6. **Group Deletion**: `DELETE /identity/groups/<group_name>` - Delete a group from Keycloak.
7. **Group Information Retrieval**: `GET /identity/groups` - Retrieve information about all groups in Keycloak.
8. **Health Check**: `GET /ok` - Check the health of the Keycloak Backend service.

- The application uses Flask's authentication mechanisms.
- Role-based access control is implemented using `@role_required` decorators to restrict certain actions to users with specific roles, such as 'app-admin'.

### Environment Configuration
